### Installation

Install from PyPI

    pip install django-readers

## tl;dr

`django-readers` is a library to help with organising business logic in a Django codebase, following a function-oriented style. It allows you to concisely specify data dependencies in your views and attempts to extract and transform that data as efficiently as possible, eliminating the [N+1 queries problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping). It introduces a few simple concepts, and provides some tools to assemble them together into a working application. It can easily be combined with existing patterns and libraries.

* **queryset preparation functions** replace custom queryset methods and encapsulate data selection: filtering, annotation etc. They can be composed to express complex selection logic.
* **projector functions** replace model methods and encapsulate business logic for transforming and presenting data. They can be combined to form lightweight business objects (dictionaries) that are the right shape for the code that consumes them.
* **reader pairs** combine queryset functions and projectors, expressing the dependencies between them.
* a high-level **spec** provides a concise way to express exactly which data should be selected and projected at the point of use.

## A note on this documentation

`django-readers` is as much a set of recommended patterns as it is a library of code. This README attempts to explain the reasoning behind the patterns, and give some examples of how the library helps you to implement them. However, you are strongly encouraged to read the source to fully understand `django-readers`: it's quite straightforward and only 200 or so lines of code. Also, the tests (under `tests/`) provide some real-world examples of how each "layer" of the library might be used, so they are worth reading too.

## Motivation

Django common practices encourage a "fat models" approach. That is: most of the business logic of the application goes in the model layer (on the models themselves, or on custom managers or querysets). This is often a bad idea for several reasons:

First, it goes against the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle). Models are already responsible for mapping between your database tables and your application code and back again. This mapping is a highly complex task, and that's quite enough for one set of classes to be responsible for.

Second, it is bad for code organisation, particularly in larger projects. Your `models.py` becomes a trash pile onto which all business logic is dumped. Models and querysets grow to thousands of lines of code. The API surface area for each model becomes huge, and this entire surface is available to any part of your application that imports the model.

Third and worst, often model methods themselves perform queries against other models. This is a disaster for application performance, leading to inefficient query patterns that can be very difficult to fix. When they _are_ fixed (through judicious use of `select_related` and `prefetch_related` on the queryset), the model methods become tightly bound to the precise way that the query is built, resulting in unpredictable and brittle code.

**`django-readers` encourages you to instead structure your code around plain functions rather than methods on classes. You can put these functions wherever you like in your codebase. Complex business logic is built by composing and combining these functions.**

`django-readers` provides a set of tools to help with the parts of your business logic that are responsible for _reads_ from the database: selecting and transforming data before presenting it to clients. It is designed to be used with Django templates as well as Django REST framework.

The functionality that `django-readers` provides is deliberately straightforward and interoperable with existing Django libraries, patterns and practices. You can choose to use just the parts of `django-readers` that appeal to you and make sense in your project.

## Features and concepts

`django-readers` is organised in three layers of _"reader functions"_. At the highest level of abstraction is `django_readers.specs` (the top layer), which depends on `django_readers.pairs` (the middle layer), which depends on `django_readers.projectors` and `django_readers.qs` (the bottom layer).

These layers can be intermingled in a real-world application. To expain each layer, it makes most sense to start at the bottom and work upwards.

### `django_readers.qs`: queryset preparation functions

A queryset preparation function is a function that accepts a queryset as its single argument, and returns a new queryset with some modifications applied.

```
def prepare(queryset):
    return queryset.filter(name="shakespeare")
```

These functions are used to encapsulate database query logic which would traditionally live in a custom queryset method.

`django-readers` provides a library of functions (under `django_readers.qs`) which mirror all the default methods on the base `QuerySet` that return a new queryset.

Queryset functions can be combined with the `pipe` function (named following standard functional programming parlance). `qs.pipe` returns a new queryset function that calls each function in its argument list in turn, passing the return value of the first as the argument of the second, and so on. It literally "pipes" your queryset through its list of functions.

```python
from django_readers import qs

recent_books_with_prefetched_authors = qs.pipe(
    qs.filter(year__gte=2020),
    qs.prefetch_related("author_set"),
    qs.order_by("name"),
)

queryset = recent_books_with_prefetched_authors(Book.objects.all())
```

### `django_readers.projectors`: model projection functions

A projector is a function that accepts a model instance as its single argument, and returns a dictionary containing some subset or transformation of the instance data.

These functions "project" your data layer into your application's business logic domain. Business logic that would traditionally go in model methods should instead go in projectors.

Think of the dictionary returned by a projector (the "projection") as the simplest possible domain object. In most cases, it makes sense for an individual projector function to return a dictionary containing just a single key and value.

```python
from datetime import datetime

def project_age(instance):
    return {"age": datetime.now().year - instance.birth_year}

author = Author(name="Some Author", birth_year=1984)
print(project_age(author))
#  {'age': 37}
```

The simplest projector is one that returns the value of an object attribute, wrapped in a dictionary with the attribute name as its single key. `django-readers` provides a projector that does this:

```python
from django_readers import projectors

author = Author(name="Some Author")
project = projectors.attr("name")
print(project(author))
#  {'name': 'Some Author'}
```

A dictionary is returned because these projectors are intended to be _composable_: multiple simple projector functions can be combined into a more complex projector function that returns a dictionary containing the keys from all of its child projectors.

This composition generally happens at the place in your codebase where the domain model is actually being _used_ (in a view, say). The projection will therefore contain precisely the keys needed by that view. This solves the problem of models becoming vast ever-growing flat namespaces containing all the functionality needed by all parts of your application.

Projectors can be combined. The keys and values from the dictionary returned by each individual projector are merged togther.

```python
from django_readers import projectors

project = projectors.combine(
    projectors.attr("name"),
    project_age,
)
print(project(author))
#  {'name': 'Some Author', 'age': 37}
```

Related objects can also be projected using the `projectors.relationship` function, resulting in a nested projection:

```python
project = projectors.combine(
    projectors.attr("name"),
    project_age,
    projectors.relationship("book_set", projectors.combine(
        projectors.attr("title"),
        projectors.attr("publication_year"),
    )),
)
print(project(author))
#  {'name': 'Some Author', 'age': 37, 'book_set': [{'title': 'Some Book', 'publication_year': 2019}]}
```

Projectors can also be aliased, which means replacing one or more keys in the returned dictionary. If the projector to be aliased returns a dictionary with a single key, the `alias` function can be given a single string as its first argument, which will replace this key. If the projector returns multiple keys, a mapping of `{"old_name": "new_name"}` must be used.

```python
project = projectors.alias(
    "year_of_birth", projectors.attr("birth_year")
)
```

Finally, the `projectors.method` function will call the given method name on the instance, returning the result under a key matching the method name. Any extra arguments passed to `projectors.method` will be passed along to the method.

### `django_readers.pairs`: "reader pairs" combining `prepare` and `project`

`prepare` and `project` functions are intimately connected, with the `project` function usually depending on fields, annotations or relationships loaded by the `prepare` function. For this reason, `django-readers` expects these functions to live together in a two-tuple called a reader pair: `(prepare, project)`.

In the example used above, the `project_age` projector depends on the `birth_year` field:

```python
age_pair = (qs.include_fields("birth_year"), project_age)
```

`django-readers` includes some useful functions that create pairs. These attempt to produce the most efficient queries they can, which means loading only those database fields which are required to project your query:

```python
from django_readers import pairs

prepare, project = pairs.field("name")
queryset = prepare(Author.objects.all())
print(queryset.query)
#  SELECT "author"."id", "author"."name" FROM "author"
result = project(queryset.first())
print(project(author))
#  {'name': 'Some Author'}
```

Relationships can automatically be loaded and projected, too:

```python
prepare, project = pairs.combine(
    pairs.field("name"),
    age_pair,
    pairs.auto_relationship("book_set", pairs.combine(
        pairs.field("title"),
        pairs.field("publication_year"),
    ))
)
```

Again, only the precise fields that are needed are loaded from the database. All relationship functions take an optional `to_attr` argument which is passed to the underlying `Prefetch` object and also changes the key name in the projection.

Note that `django-readers` _always_ uses `prefetch_related` to load relationships, even in circumstances where `select_related` would usually be used (ie `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField`), resulting in one query per relationship. This approach allows the code to be "fractal": the tree of `(prepare, project)` pairs can be recursively applied to the tree of related querysets.

Of course, it is quite possible to use `select_related` by applying `qs.select_related` at the root of your query, but this must be done manually. `django-readers` also provides `qs.select_related_fields`, which combines `select_related` with `include_fields` to allow you to specify exactly which fields you need from the related objects.

You can use `pairs.pk_list` to project a list containing just the primary keys of the related objects.

It is also possible to wrap a pair in `pairs.alias`, which takes the same alias argument as `projectors.alias` (see above), and applies it to the projector part of the pair:

```python
prepare, project = pairs.alias(
    "year_of_birth", pairs.field("birth_year")
)
```

As a shortcut, the `pairs` module provides a function called `filter`, which can be used to apply a filter to the queryset without affecting the projection. This is equivalent to `(qs.filter(arg=value), projectors.noop)` and is most useful for filtering related objects:

```python
prepare, project = pairs.combine(
    pairs.field("name"),
    age_pair,
    pairs.auto_relationship(
        "book_set",
        pairs.combine(
            pairs.filter(publication_year__gte=2020),
            pairs.field("title"),
            pairs.field("publication_year"),
        ),
        to_attr="recent_books"
    )
)
```

`django-readers` also comes with a pair function for working with Django's `get_FOO_display` mechanism. From the Django docs:

> For every field that has `choices` set, the object will have a `get_FOO_display()` method, where `FOO` is the name of the field. This method returns the “human-readable” value of the field.

The `pairs.field_display` function takes the field name as its single argument and returns a pair which loads the field from the database, and then projects the result of calling `get_<field>_display` under the key `<field>_display`.

### `django_readers.specs`: a high-level specification for efficient data querying and projection

This layer is the real magic of `django-readers`: a straightforward way of specifying the shape of your data in order to efficiently select and project a complex tree of related objects.

The resulting nested dictionary structure may be returned from as view as a JSON response (assuming all your projectors return JSON-serializable values), or included in a template context in place of a queryset or model instance.

A spec is a list. Under the hood, the `specs` module is a very lightweight wrapper on top of `pairs` - it applies simple transformations to the items in the list to replace them with the relevant pair functions. The list may contain:

* _strings_, which are interpreted as field names and are replaced with `pairs.field`,
* _dictionaries_, which are interpreted as relationships (with the keys specifying the relationship name and the values being specs for projecting the related objects) and are replaced with `pairs.auto_relationship`.
* _pairs_ of `(prepare, project)` functions (see previous section), which are left as-is.

The example from the last section may be written as the following spec:

```python
from django_readers import specs

prepare, project = specs.process(
    [
        "name",
        age_pair,
        {"book_set": ["title", "publication_year"]},
    ]
)

queryset = prepare(Author.objects.all())
result = [project(instance) for instance in queryset]
```

The structure of this specification is heavily inspired by [`django-rest-framework-serialization-spec`](https://github.com/dabapps/django-rest-framework-serialization-spec/), minus the concept of "plugins", which are replaced with directly including `(prepare, project)` pairs in the spec. It should be trivial to convert or "adapt" a `serialization-spec` plugin into a suitable `django-readers` pair.

It is also possible to wrap a spec item in `specs.alias`, which takes the same alias argument as `pairs.alias` (see above), and applies it to the spec item:

```python
prepare, project = specs.process(
    [
        specs.alias("year_of_birth", "birth_year"),
    ]
)
```

### A note on `django-zen-queries`

An important pattern to avoid inefficient database queries in Django projects is to isolate the *fetching of data* from the *rendering of data*. This pattern can be implemented with the help of [`django-zen-queries`](https://github.com/dabapps/django-zen-queries), which allows you to mark blocks of code under which database queries are not allowed.

In a project using `django-readers`, it is good practice to disallow queries in the `prepare` and `project` phases:

```python
import zen_queries

prepare, project = specs.process([
    # some spec
])

with zen_queries.queries_disabled():
    queryset = prepare(Author.objects.all())

queryset = zen_queries.fetch(queryset)  # execute the database queries

with zen_queries.queries_disabled():
    result = [project(instance) for instance in queryset]

# ...render result as JSON or in a template
```

To enforce this, if `django-zen-queries` is installed, `django-readers` will automatically apply
`queries_disabled()` to the `prepare` and `project` functions returned by `specs.process`, so there is no need to apply it manually as in the above example.

### Where should this code go?

We recommend that your custom functions go in a file called `readers.py` inside your Django apps. Specs should be declared at the point they are used, usually in your `views.py`.

### What about other types of business logic?

You'll notice that `django-readers` is focused on _reads_: business logic which selects some data from the database and/or transforms it in such a way that it can be displayed to a user. What about other common types of business logic that involve accepting input from users and processing it?

`django-readers` doesn't provide any code to help with this, but we encourage you to follow the same function-oriented philosophy. Structure your codebase around functions which take model instances and encapsulate these sorts of write actions. You might choose to call them `action functions` and place them in a file called `actions.py`.

The other common task needed is data validation. We'd suggest Django forms and/or Django REST framework serializers are perfectly adequate here.

### Is `django-readers` a "service layer"?

Not really, although it does solve some of the same problems. It suggests alternative (and, we think, beneficial) ways to structure your business logic without attempting to hide or abstract away the underlying Django concepts, and so should be easily understandable by any experienced Django developer. You can easily "mix and match" `django-readers` concepts into an existing application.

If you are someone who feels more comfortable thinking in terms of established Design Patterns, you may consider the dictionaries returned from projector functions as simple [Data Transfer Objects](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html), and the idea of dividing read and write logic into `readers` and `actions` as a version of [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html).
